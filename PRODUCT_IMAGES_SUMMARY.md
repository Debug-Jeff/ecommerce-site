# GuardMart Product Images - Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've set up a complete system for organizing and implementing high-quality product images for your GuardMart supermarket app.

## What I've Created

### 1. Directory Structure
```
C:\Users\HP\Documents\My_Files\Projects\GuardMart\public\products\
├── fresh-produce/
├── dairy-eggs/
├── meat-poultry/
├── beverages/
├── pantry/
└── household/
```

### 2. Documentation Files
- **`product-image-guide.md`** - Complete guide for sourcing images
- **`update-product-images.js`** - Script to update your mockData.ts
- **`PRODUCT_IMAGES_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document

## Product Image Mapping

Your mockData.ts currently has 20 products that need images:

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Download Images
1. Visit the recommended free stock photo sites:
   - **Pexels** (pexels.com) - Best overall quality
   - **Pixabay** (pixabay.com) - Large grocery selection
   - **Unsplash** (unsplash.com) - High-quality professional photos
   - **Freepik** (freepik.com) - Good product shots

2. Use the search terms provided in `product-image-guide.md`
3. Download high-resolution images (minimum 800x800px)
4. Rename files according to the mapping above
5. Place them in the appropriate category folders

### Step 2: Update Your App
Once you have downloaded the images:

```bash
# Check which images are available
node update-product-images.js

# Update mockData.ts with new image paths
node update-product-images.js --update
```

### Step 3: Verify Implementation
After updating, your products will display with real images instead of placeholders.

## Technical Notes

- Next.js will automatically optimize images
- Current mockData.ts uses placeholder.svg - these will be replaced
- File paths are relative to the public directory
- No additional configuration needed for Next.js to serve these images
